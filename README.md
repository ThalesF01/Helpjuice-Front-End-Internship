Project created for an internship test at Helpjuice, aiming to replicate a page and develop a Notion-like editor that converts plain text into a header and displays it on the screen.

The code was created using only HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, without using any frameworks or libraries.

All the links in the project are for illustrative purposes only. The only interactive element is the input in the middle of the screen, where you can type text normally, press Enter, and it will appear on the screen. Alternatively, you can type /1, press Enter, then type something and press Enter again, and a bold header will appear on the screen. You can also select either plain text or the header by clicking on the option that appears when the input is selected.

The deployment of the project is available for review at the following Vercel link: https://helpjuice-front-end-internship.vercel.app/.
